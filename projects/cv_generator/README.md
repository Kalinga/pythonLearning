# Keeping my Curriculum Vitae is one of the most difficult task for me.
1. I don't like MS word to be used for my CV
2. PDF is the best alternative to have the CV conents in it
3. Converting MS word file each time i modify the contents using a free tool in the internet
    is something i hate most.
4. I love using Linux/Ubuntu systems. And MS word does not work seamlessly on Ubuntu
5. Converting MS Word to Libre office files, back and forth is tedious and something can be avoided
6. So all the problems can be solved if i can generate the PDF using python, and which i could very well
7. "If you are lazy....then try to be super lazy" Make the generator work for you.

The Project can be installed using
'sudo python setup.py install'

I plan to use 'django-pdfkit' for this task however facing some problems now,
and used 'pdfkit' for quick solution to this problem
